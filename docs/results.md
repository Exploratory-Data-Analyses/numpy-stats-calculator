## Explanation of the Calculations

The script performs the following calculations on the input list of numbers:
- **Mean**: The average value.
- **Variance**: The measure of dispersion, indicating how much the values differ from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation**: The square root of the variance, representing the amount of variation or dispersion.
- **Maximum**: The largest value.
- **Minimum**: The smallest value.
- **Sum**: The total sum of all values.

These calculations are performed along two axes (axis 0 and axis 1) as well as for the overall data.

## Plotting the Results

The results of the calculations are visualized in a plot; The plot consists of boxplots for each of the statistical 
measures calculated along axis 0, axis 1, and the overall data.

### Explanation of the Resulting Plots

The resulting plot `results.png` contains 3 rows and 2 columns of subplots, each representing one of the statistical 
measures (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum).

1. **Mean**: 
    - The boxplot for the mean shows the distribution of the mean values calculated along axis 0, axis 1, and overall.
2. **Variance**: 
    - The boxplot for the variance shows the distribution of the variance values calculated along axis 0, axis 1, and overall.
3. **Standard Deviation**: 
    - The boxplot for the standard deviation shows the distribution of the standard deviation values calculated along axis 0, axis 1, and overall.
4. **Max**: 
    - The boxplot for the max values shows the distribution of the maximum values calculated along axis 0, axis 1, and overall.
5. **Min**: 
    - The boxplot for the min values shows the distribution of the minimum values calculated along axis 0, axis 1, and overall.
6. **Sum**: 
    - The boxplot for the sum values shows the distribution of the sum values calculated along axis 0, axis 1, and overall.

Each subplot contains three boxplots:
- **Axis 0**: Calculations performed along columns.
- **Axis 1**: Calculations performed along rows.
- **Overall**: Calculations performed on the entire array.

The boxplots provide a visual summary of the statistical measures, showing the median, quartiles, and potential outliers for each set of calculations.
